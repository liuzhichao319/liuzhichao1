[IBM Bluemix DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside Bluemix. The "Create Toolchain" button creates a DevOps toolchain and acts as a single-click deploy to Bluemix including provisioning all required services. 

***Note** you must publish your project to [Github](https://github.com/) for this to work.


### Configuration

The project contains Bluemix specific files that are used to deploy the application as part of a Bluemix DevOps flow. The `.bluemix` directory contains files used to define the Bluemix toolchain and pipeline for your application. The `manifest.yml` file specifies the name of your application in Bluemix, the timeout value during deployment, and which services to bind to.

Credentials are either taken from the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable if in Bluemix, or from a config file if running locally. 


### Run
#### Using Bluemix development CLI
The Bluemix development plugin makes it easy to compile and run your application if you do not have all of the tools installed on your computer yet. Your application will be compiled with Docker containers. To compile and run your app, run:

```
bash
bx dev build
bx dev run
```


#### Using your local development environment



##### Endpoints

Your application is running at: `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

- Health endpoint: `/health`
